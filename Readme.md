# Senior-Project

The goal of my senior project is to create a tool for elementary school teachers to be able to track their students' progress.
Teachers will be able to create quizzes for their students and when students take the quizzes, statistics about how well the students do on the quizzes will be gathered to track the students progress. The statistics can be used by the teacher to see what areas of study they may need to review or focus on in the future.

This project will be implemented using the Django python web framework.

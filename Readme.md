# Senior-Project

The goal of my senior project is to create a tool for elementary school teachers to be able to track their students' progress.
Teachers will be able to create quizzes for their students and when students take the quizzes, statistics about how quickly and how well the students do on the quizzes will be gathered to track the students progress.
These statistics can be used to generate a report about the students progress and how well they are doing in relation to the rest of the class. The statistics can be used by the teacher to see what areas of study they may need to review or focus on in the future.
These progress reports will be abe to automatically be sent to parents to check their student's progress if the tacher and parent choose to enable it.


This project will be implemented using the Django python web framework and will be deployed using Apache on an AWS Server.
